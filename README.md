# SciScript-Python

## SciServer Python libraries for Jupyter Notebooks

This python package provides functions for quick access to [SciServer](http://www.sciserver.org) APIs (web services) and tools.
[SciServer](http://www.sciserver.org) provides a new online framework for data-intensive scientifc computing in the cloud,
where the motto is to bring the computation close where the data is stored, and allow seamless access and sharing of big data sets within the scientific community.

Some SciServer tools you can access with this package:

 * [Login Portal](http://portal.sciserver.org): Single sign-on portal to all SciServer applications.

 * [CasJobs](http://skyserver.sdss.org/CasJobs): Database storage and querying.

* SciQuery: Advanced Database storage and querying.

 * [SciDrive](http://www.scidrive.org/): Drag-and-drop file storage and sharing.

 * [SkyServer](http://skyserver.sdss.org/): Access to the SDSS astronomical survey.

 * [SkyQuery](http://www.voservices.net/skyquery): Cross-match of astronomical source catalogs.
 
 * [Compute Jobs](http://apps.sciserver.org/compute/jobs) and [SciQuery Jobs](http://apps.sciserver.org/sciquery-ui/): Synch and asynch submission of Jupyter notebooks, shell commands and SQL queries.
 
 * [Files](http://apps.sciserver.org/dashboard/files): Interact with the SciServer file system.

## 1) Cloning the code locally:

1.1.- Run `git clone http://github.com/sciserver/SciScript-Python.git`

## 2) Setting configuration parameters:

2.1.- Open `./py2/SciServer/Config.py` and `./py3/SciServer/Config.py`, and edit the API URLs and parameters to match those of the SciServer tools and installation, according to the instructions and descriptions found therein.

## 3) Installation:

First, add required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

There are 2 possibilities: automatic or manual installation.

### a) Automatic Installation and Update:

3.a.1.- Run `python ShowSciServerTags.py` in order to see the version tags that label each SciServer release containing new SciScript code.

3.a.2.- To install or update, run `python Install.py tag`, where `tag` is the version tag of the SciServer release containing the SciScript version you want to install or update to (see previous step). If `tag` is not specified, then the latest version will be installed.

### b) Manual Installation:

3.b.1.- To install python 2 code, run `python setup.py install` while in the `./py2` directory.

3.b.2.- To install python 3 code, run `python3 setup.py install` while in the `./py3` directory.

## 4) Creating HTML documentation:

4.1.- Run `make html` while in the `./docs_sphinx/` directory. The html files will be created in `./docs_sphinx/_build/`

## 5) Unit Tests:

5.1.- Open `./Tests/UnitTests.py` and edit the `Authentication_loginName` and `Authentication_loginPassword` parameters in order to run the Tests under the credentials of a (test) user.

5.2.- Run `python UnitTests.py` while in the `./Tests` directory in order to run the unit tests for the SciScript-Python modules. Be sure all that all tests end with an `OK` status.

## 6) Examples.

6.1.- In the directory `./Examples` you can find python scripts or Jupyter notebooks that will run sample code using SciScript-Python modules and methods.
